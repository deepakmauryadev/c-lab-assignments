## Recursion

A recursive function is one that calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a smaller version of it's task untill a final call
which does not require anymore self call.

### Advantages of Recursion

- Problems are decomposed to smaller problems.
- Recursive calls minimise the problem size.
- Base case is a instance of a problem the solution of which requires no more further recursive calls.

### Questions on Recursion

- fib
- gcd
- factorial
- sum of digits of number
